# WordMaster
WordMaster is a word game similar to Wordle. The aim of the game is to guess the secret word, the length of which is determined by the player, within the number of rounds also determined by the player. The closer the player gets to the secret word; the more advantage player gets. If the positions of the letters in the word the player guessed are the same, that letter of the word becomes visible. If the words are made of the same letter but have different places, they are indicated by the letter * in a random place. Also, the player does not know which letter it is. The player earns points according to the number of turns player finds the word and the length of the word and gets saved into the database. If the word is not found in the selected number of rounds, the player loses. If the player does not log in and played as a guest none of player’s stats are saved to the database. While in log in screen if the username does not match with any of the usernames in database and typed password is allowable ask if the player wants to create a new account. If yes goes straight into the game and saves the player’s name and password to database.
